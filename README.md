About the Application

The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web-based application developed using ASP.NET MVC.

The system improves transparency, reduces manual paperwork, and ensures that claim processes are tracked efficiently.

Coordinator: Review lecturer claims, approve/reject, or request further verification.

Academic Manager: Perform final approval or rejection of claims, ensuring accountability.

User Accounts: Secure login and registration for different roles.
